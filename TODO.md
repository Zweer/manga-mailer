# TODO

- [x] Don't use chapter count, use last chapter index instead
- [x] There's something strange with the search... am I considering all the fields?
- [x] Add an icon to identify a completed manga
- [ ] The status of the manga in its page (Ongoing, Completed, ...)
- [ ] If a connector is "slow" (like omegascans since it has to fetch every single chapter page) upon manga addition, have a special section where you can "lazy load" the manga
